# DVD-Screen-Saver
DVD screen saver on HTML canvas
The path of the DVD logo is similar to a Lissajous curve, which is a parametric curve that has different sine and cosine periods; it can be said that a circle drawn parametrically is a Lissajous curve whose periods are both one.

To use, download the repository and open the index.html file in a browser (preferably in chrome), and is best viewed in full screen.
To change the direction/speed of the DVD logo, change the variables "xrate" and "yrate" in the script.js file; try to get it to hit the corner.
